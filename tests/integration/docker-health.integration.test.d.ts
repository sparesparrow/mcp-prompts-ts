 * This test verifies that the health check endpoint is working correctly
 * when the MCP-Prompts server is running in a Docker container.
 *
 * Note: This test requires the Docker container to be running at localhost:3003.
 * If you're running this test outside of Docker, make sure the server is started
 * with HTTP_SERVER=true and PORT=3003.
